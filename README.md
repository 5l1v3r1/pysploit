# pysploit

This is a metasploit-like framework for system exploitation and penetration 
testing written in python. It is a work in progress and is an educational 
exercise for me so I learn how things actually work and stop being such a skid.

### =-=-=-= To Do =-=-=-=

* Build network module for the framework to handle file-dropping, multi-stage payload uploading, shell-hand
ling, etc.

* Create some payloads / payload execution frameworks (based off of network module interactions)

* Potentially migrate exploitation into Twisted protocols that are created by the exploits (?)
